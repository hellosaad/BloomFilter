# BloomFilter
 This is a Project developed to compare the performance of a bloom filter with other data structures such as a HashMap and a Binary Tree. We have used a IP  address dataset from kaggle to train and also validate the performance of the said data structures. Here is a presentation on the bloom filter which discusses the findings from this project. https://youtu.be/Y7C2HDdTWH8
